# CIS106 Luke Costanza

## Assignment 1

For the Fall semester I am taking this course simply because it is a requirment for a future transfer school I am hoping to attend in the spring of 2022. If it weren't for the requirment I would have probably been too nervouse to take a programming class, especially one that is all online. Either way this class will be very beneficial for my future career aspirations. I am majoring in Physical Geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The Technology and programs that I will be using in my future are mainly focused around the Python language and C++ language, but to my understanding C++ is very advanced for a beginner. I am hoping to obtain my bachelors at U of I Urbana-Champaign or Northen Illinois University. My top pick being U of I as there Program encompasses more of what I want to focus on, that being GIS.  

## Assignment 2

During this second week, I decided on using Python for my coding language. My main reason is for its future use to me in my career path, But I have now learned that it is the simplest language to pick up which is a plus for me too. I will be using Python as an instruction writer for future data types and statements in the GIS programs like ArcGIS. The IDE I used to test my activity 1.py code was Thonny and I intend on using it for the remainder of the course. 

## Assignment 3

I learned Lots from this week's assignment. From figuring out that Python is case sensitive to learning that objects don't always need a function written before them while writing a string (str). The biggest lesson I learned was to watch out for parenthesis in each line of code. the purpose for each pair of parentheses is to contain a statement/ function for the computer to read separate of the other pairs of parentheses. Also very simple yet very important, any function that has an equal sign after it will be read by the computer as a variable and not a function even though it will still show its specific color code. These new lessons will be able to ask questions through my code and be able to answer a variety of questions given by the user. 

## Assignment 4

Not too many new ideas or experiences during this week but the knowledge was still consumed and I did learn a thing or two. The first memorable thing that was implemented into my Activity 6.py file was the use of float instead of integer. This allowed the user to input a decimal number for the price of a paint gallon and use the real number for the calculations. Something else that I re-taught myself was the importance of reading the directions vigorously. As these assignments slowly increase in difficulty doing the correct steps is vital to creating an A+ assignment. This week's activity 6 in particular was difficult in organizing my code for the correct variables to calculate with their respective pair. Too often I checked my code and found many miscalculations and I would not be surprised if there were more if I'm being honest. Overall this was an informative week and look forward to corrections and insights in my work.
