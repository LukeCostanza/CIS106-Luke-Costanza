# CIS106-Luke-Costanza
For the Fall semester I am taking this course simply because it is a requirment for a future transfer school I am hoping to attend in the spring of 2022. If it weren't for the requirment I would have probably been too nervouse to take a programming class, especially one that is all online. Either way this class will be very beneficial for my future career aspirations.
