# CIS106 Luke Costanza

## Assignment 1

For the Fall semester I am taking this course simply because it is a requirment for a future transfer school I am hoping to attend in the spring of 2022. If it weren't for the requirment I would have probably been too nervouse to take a programming class, especially one that is all online. Either way this class will be very beneficial for my future career aspirations. I am majoring in Physical Geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The Technology and programs that I will be using in my future are mainly focused around the Python language and C++ language, but to my understanding C++ is very advanced for a beginner. I am hoping to obtain my bachelors at U of I Urbana-Champaign or Northen Illinois University. My top pick being U of I as there Program encompasses more of what I want to focus on, that being GIS.  

## Assignment 2

During this second week, I decided on using Python for my coding language. My main reason is for its future use to me in my career path, But I have now learned that it is the simplest language to pick up which is a plus for me too. I will be using Python as an instruction writer for future data types and statements in the GIS programs like ArcGIS. The IDE I used to test my activity 1.py code was Thonny and I intend on using it for the remainder of the course. 

## Assignment 3

I learned Lots from this week's assignment. From figuring out that Python is case sensitive to learning that objects don't always need a function written before them while writing a string (str). The biggest lesson I learned was to watch out for parenthesis in each line of code. the purpose for each pair of parentheses is to contain a statement/ function for the computer to read separate of the other pairs of parentheses. Also very simple yet very important, any function that has an equal sign after it will be read by the computer as a variable and not a function even though it will still show its specific color code. These new lessons will be able to ask questions through my code and be able to answer a variety of questions given by the user. 

## Assignment 4

Not too many new ideas or experiences during this week but the knowledge was still consumed and I did learn a thing or two. The first memorable thing that was implemented into my Activity 6.py file was the use of float instead of integer. This allowed the user to input a decimal number for the price of a paint gallon and use the real number for the calculations. Something else that I re-taught myself was the importance of reading the directions vigorously. As these assignments slowly increase in difficulty doing the correct steps is vital to creating an A+ assignment. This week's activity 6 in particular was difficult in organizing my code for the correct variables to calculate with their respective pair. Too often I checked my code and found many miscalculations and I would not be surprised if there were more if I'm being honest. Overall this was an informative week and look forward to corrections and insights in my work.

## Assignment 5

This week was an eventful week for learning a more challenging topic. I took advantage of the office hours provided by both our professor and other professors. The 15-minute video call was very very helpful and would 100% recommend it to anyone else looking for some extra help. I think I understand how the class works now and what is expected of me when turning in assignments and at what time. Overall excited for the next topic and cant wait to learn a little bit more.

## Assignment 6

After going through a rough week with assignment 5 I was able to resurrect myself and my grade by taking the time to seek help from my professor. I was provided with the info I needed to complete assignment 6 to the best of my ability. After some trial and error, I was able to get most of the program to work. I even sought some help from my sister again but these assignments are starting to get the best of her and at this point, she will be learning at the same speed I am. I hope that these new functions will stick with me as we move along to week 7.

## Assignment 7 

So far it's a little scarier then earlier assignments but smoother. What I mean by that is the amount of time it takes to write old code that we already know is drastically quicker and makes more sense when an error pops up. After a couple of days of procrastinating because of work and other homework, I was able to get help from Hafsa. She went through code using similar directions and using functions/ if, else statements. This help was very nice and very helpful as I was also contacting her at the end of her session time. The codethem came together and was finished!


## Assignment 8 

This week will be extra challenging for me because I am on vacation with minimal connection to the internet. I believe That my Activity 1 is to the standards of assignment 8 but would like feedback either way. I also understand that my Activity.2 is struggling and would like feedback on that too. Other than that my main worries are when I should use either While, for, and do loops. They are quite confusing and being a new subject some light explanation would work wonders. I will be coming back to this paragraph before Thursday. 

## Assignment 9 

After a fairly stressful week, having homework assignments pile up on top of being on vacation I almost went crazy. Though in that week of always feeling like I was losing my breath, I was able to catch a breeze of fresh air and get myself back on my feet. After seeking help from many resources including you I was able to understand loops and how to incorporate them into functions. Now, this week's assignments of "Do while loops" is fairly simple and is much more clear to understand even if my functions don't completely work. I am proud ow to say that I will most likely be getting full credit on assignment 9 and participation for assignment 9 this will be the first time in his class and it is what I need to keep improving my grade.

## Assignment 10

Just like last week I gave myself enough time to evaluate the homework assigned and scheduled a meeting for some extra assistance. The for loop and nested loop assignments I completed gave me a nice broad understanding of loops and lots of the recent concepts were brought into one. I am looking forward to seeing how all these concepts truly collide when we start to learn about arrays. Also, I am aware that my Activity 2.fprg is not finished and needs work as I thought it would. After the feedback received on Tuesday, I was able to look back through my flowgorithm flow chart and notice the mistake. I simply placed a greater than symbol in place of a less than symbol.  


## Assignment 11

This week was not one for me. I was backed up on more stuff in my life than ever before thus the late turn in for this assignment. After learning this for the first time just yesterday and coding this today with some help I have finally completed it. The reason for all of the technical words is still somewhat confusing to me, But other than that arrays are somewhat simple(I might be lying to myself). I hope that assignment 12 is much smoother. 


## Assignment 12

After one week of working very hard on other assignments and falling behind, I finally came to my senses to work on the array codes from sessions 11 and 12. After going through session 11 and seeing how arrays work session 12 was much easier to understand. I found that arrays are very useful when creating lists or getting data and storing it from a user. Compared to a while loop where it will take the data then do something with it directly after. Now that I am back on track I hope that I can pay more attention to detail and to this class in general!

## Assignment 13

I am enjoying strings so far. The idea that we can control what the user inputs is very interesting and opens up a whole new world of coding to experience. I feel that this is also going to be used a lot when there is lots of data to work with when I am using Python in my career. 

## Assignment 14

Learning about files made this whole class feel more realistic for coding as a career. It brought in aspects of everyday life allowing us to see how our laptops or desktops work when we use files. I'm also learning about the importance of naming files correctly in my GIS class. You must name these locations in your files so that when you decide to save data to that location it works correctly and efficiently. 

## Final Project

After a little hiccup at the beginning where I simply could not get the file to run because I was missing a single line, The process started to run smoother. I am having a hard time trying to figure out why every single part of the file is printing. Other than that little issue I still have some steps to finish but I am closer than I was. I believe I have finished the project and can move onto studying for the final exam. This project proved to be very challenging as it took me multiple days to work through the code.
