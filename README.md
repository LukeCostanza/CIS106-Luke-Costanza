# CIS106 Luke Costanza

## Assignment 1

For the Fall semester I am taking this course simply because it is a requirment for a future transfer school I am hoping to attend in the spring of 2022. If it weren't for the requirment I would have probably been too nervouse to take a programming class, especially one that is all online. Either way this class will be very beneficial for my future career aspirations. I am majoring in Physical Geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The Technology and programs that I will be using in my future are mainly focused around the Python language and C++ language, but to my understanding C++ is very advanced for a beginner. I am hoping to obtain my bachelors at U of I Urbana-Champaign or Northen Illinois University. My top pick being U of I as there Program encompasses more of what I want to focus on, that being GIS.  

## Assignment 2

During this second week, I decided on using Python for my coding language. My main reason is for its future use to me in my career path, But I have now learned that it is the simplest language to pick up which is a plus for me too. I will be using Python as an instruction writer for future data types and statements in the GIS programs like ArcGIS. The IDE I used to test my activity 1.py code was Thonny and I intend on using it for the remainder of the course. 

## Assignment 3

I learned Lots from this week's assignment. From figuring out that Python is case sensitive to learning that objects don't always need a function written before them while writing a string (str). The biggest lesson I learned was to watch out for parenthesis in each line of code. the purpose for each pair of parentheses is to contain a statement/ function for the computer to read separate of the other pairs of parentheses. Also very simple yet very important, any function that has an equal sign after it will be read by the computer as a variable and not a function even though it will still show its specific color code. These new lessons will be able to ask questions through my code and be able to answer a variety of questions given by the user. 

## Assignment 4

Not too many new ideas or experiences during this week but the knowledge was still consumed and I did learn a thing or two. The first memorable thing that was implemented into my Activity 6.py file was the use of float instead of integer. This allowed the user to input a decimal number for the price of a paint gallon and use the real number for the calculations. Something else that I re-taught myself was the importance of reading the directions vigorously. As these assignments slowly increase in difficulty doing the correct steps is vital to creating an A+ assignment. This week's activity 6 in particular was difficult in organizing my code for the correct variables to calculate with their respective pair. Too often I checked my code and found many miscalculations and I would not be surprised if there were more if I'm being honest. Overall this was an informative week and look forward to corrections and insights in my work.

## Assignment 5

This week was an eventful week for learning a more challenging topic. I took advantage of the office hours provided by both our professor and other professors. The 15-minute video call was very very helpful and would 100% recommend it to anyone else looking for some extra help. I think I understand how the class works now and what is expected of me when turning in assignments and at what time. Overall excited for the next topic and cant wait to learn a little bit more.

## Assignment 6

After going through a rough week with assignment 5 I was able to resurrect myself and my grade by taking the time to seek help from my professor. I was provided with the info I needed to complete assignment 6 to the best of my ability. After some trial and error, I was able to get most of the program to work. I even sought some help from my sister again but these assignments are starting to get the best of her and at this point, she will be learning at the same speed I am. I hope that these new functions will stick with me as we move along to week 7.

## Assignment 7 

So far it's a little scarier then earlier assignments but smoother. What I mean by that is the amount of time it takes to write old code that we already know is drastically quicker and makes more sense when an error pops up. After a couple of days of procrastinating because of work and other homework, I was able to get help from Hafsa. She went through code using similar directions and using functions/ if, else statements. This help was very nice and very helpful as I was also contacting her at the end of her session time. The code them came together and was finished!
